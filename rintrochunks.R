1.4 R and the window system
The most convenient way to use R is at a graphics workstation running a windowing system.
This guide is aimed at users who have this facility. In particular we will occasionally refer to
the use of R on an X window system although the vast bulk of what is said applies generally to
any implementation of the R environment.
